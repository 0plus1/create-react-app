### Create React App Starter
A highly opinionated react starter using CRA.

This repository is a base template for your own application.

The idea is to have a basic stub of all the moving part of a react + redux application, so you can jump in straight away and start coding your own application.


### Install

```

```

### Rationale

Why prop-types and not typescript?
```
TODO
```

### Stubs
In this template you will find several pre-configured stubs:

#### react-router
* Router parameters
* prop-types validation

#### react-redux
* Example actions and reducers
* Complex exports with chained HOC

#### axios
* axios abstraction with interceptors for HTTP status codes

### Coding guidelines

#### Naming conventions
* Files containing JSX should be capitalised
* Folder names should be lowercase

#### Folder stucture
* _views_ contains all the router views
* _components_ contains all the components, big components should be placed in an individual folder with a index.js entry point.

#### Linting
Do not disable rules.
